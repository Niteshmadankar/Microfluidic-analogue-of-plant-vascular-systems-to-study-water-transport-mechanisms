# Microfluidic-analogue-of-plant-vascular-systems-to-study-water-transport-mechanisms
Experimental anatomy of plant combined with the numerical simulation method will be a useful one for analysing the flow through the xylem vessel. Aim is to develop a microfluidic model to analyse flow through xylem vessels
