# Unveiling the Effect of Age on Water Transport Mechanisms in Plant Vascular Systems
Experimental anatomy of plant combined with the numerical simulation method will be a useful one for analysing the flow through the xylem vessel. Aim is to develop a microfluidic model to analyse flow through xylem vessels
